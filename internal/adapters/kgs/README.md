# KGS - Key Generator Service
## What is KGS?
KGS is a driven adapter.

In normal link shortening services, the key is a string of random characters, so the system must search the database to find out if the key is duplicated.

But KGS have a different idea!
<hr/>

## How KGS work?
KGS is a service that provides keys by walking on a sequence of digits (counter).
KGS convert the counter to a key by using base62 encoding and move forward to the next counter.

Example output:
```
1 -> a
2 -> b
3 -> c
4 -> d
...
62 -> z
63 -> A
```

Dependencies of KGS are:

- The last generated number which stored in database.
- A function that will call to save the last generated number.

## Benefits of KGS:
- No need to query the database every time to check if the key is duplicated.

## ðŸ¤” KGS future plans:
- KGS must be able to store keys and serve them concurrently to prevent latency issues of creating keys synchronously.
- a gurdian process that watch the stored keys and generate new keys if the stored keys are not enough.
- a algorithm to detect if the stored keys are not enough based on request rate and call the gurdian process to wake up sooner then the interval time.
- In a microservice architecture, KGS should be a microservice that can be called by other microservices then we can have a cluster of link shortening services that are able to generate keys using KGS.
- Maybe change the counter name to serial
