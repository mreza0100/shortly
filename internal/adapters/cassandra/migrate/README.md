# Cassandra/migrate is a package to manage migrations for Cassandra.

## Injecting migrations into the code is not a good idea.
## unfortunately, I didn't have time to implement it in the right way.



# ðŸ¤” KGS future plans:
### The migrations should be in a separate CQL file.
### We need a tool to migrate our Cassandra database with our CQL files.
### And we also need migrations to have versions.
